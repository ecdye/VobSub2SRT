# This script was used to generate parts of langcodes.c++. Get the list of codes
# from http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/download.asp

# I'm not a big Perl hacker and this implementation probably sucks. Last time I
# used emacs keyboard macros. But this is no good if you have to repeat the
# procedure a while later. So I wanted to write a script. I hadn't done anything
# in Perl in a long time (~10 years?) so I figured I use Perl to do the job
# (instead of Bash or Python).
#
# Thanks to Aristid Breitkreuz for helping me to improve the script and my Perl style.
